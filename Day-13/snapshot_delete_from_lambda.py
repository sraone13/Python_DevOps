#Project using the boto3 in Lambda function and cost optimization


# Create the EC2 to instance it will Create the Volume also from that volume create the snapshots for backup
# When the Team member delete the Ec2 Instance it will delele the Volume, but lhe snapshots will be
# Present and it will change the cost.
# For that we have the Lambda functions using to delete the unwanted stale resources from the EC2
# Create Lambda functions and Run the code manually it will delete the snapshots which are in stale (not in use.).
